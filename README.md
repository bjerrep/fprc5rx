**fprc5rx - Field programmable RC5 receiver**

An old project that still receives requests for the source files, so here they are. This project can't possibly have any relevance in this milennium but you can be the judge of that. 

The source files are written in assembler for a PIC16F877. All files are dumped as is and how much work it will take to make the project compile is unknown. The only guarantee is that it doesn't work right now. If the unthinkable happens and you actually make it work again then please make a pull request, that would be most welcome.

Enjoy!
